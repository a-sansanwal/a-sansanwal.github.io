### Notepad.exe/vim.exe
Not great for anything but the simplest of task tracking.
Unusable on a phone. A good example is John Carmack's plan files but there exist better alternatives today.

### Onenote
There are multiple versions of this app, a desktop app and a crippled UWP app. It's meant for note taking, so its not great for lists and tracking tasks and to-do lists.

### Evernote
Note taking app first and a productivity app second.
I had trouble signing in to their windows desktop app.

### Microsoft To-do
Cross platform but not suitable for anything but shopping lists.
Microsoft has done a great job of porting it to android as well.

### Trello/Wekan
Essentially emulates sticky post-it notes on a whiteboard(kanban).
This works great for software development, not so much for day to day stuff in my opinion. The UI does not translate well to a phone screen.

### Notion
I tried out this app because they recently made it free to use for personal accounts. It's like evernote but better in many ways. Also has kanban templates
so it can replace trello/wekan. Addresses most of the complaints I have about other apps. This is what I'm using right now.
